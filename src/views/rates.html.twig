                <span>Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but the deeper pressure is beneficial in releasing chronic muscle tension. The focus is on the deepest layers of muscle tissue, tendons and fascia (the protective layer surrounding muscles, bones and joints).</span>

                <span>Circulatory massage is a very relaxing and therapeutic style of bodywork. Oil or lotion is applied to the skin so techniques such as rolling, kneading and percussion can be applied with ease. These movements promote general relaxation and improve blood circulation and assist the lymphatic system in cleansing the body of toxins.</span>

                <span>Shiatsu or “finger pressure” massage, sometimes called Zen shiatsu, is a Japanese form of physiotherapy. It is often described as the equivalent of acupressure, but this comparison is not entirely accurate, because the technique looks beyond specific pressure points, incorporating other methods such as stretching, breathing and rotating for a more whole-body approach to restoring energy balance.</span>
