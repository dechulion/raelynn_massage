   <p>My name is Raelynn and I would love to help you with your bodywork needs.</p>
   <p>Sore back, neck, or shoulder? Old injury? Experiencing a high level of  stress? Just need some time to unwind? I can help alleviate some of these  issues with a variety of massage techniques. I specialize in deep tissue,  sports, shiatsu, and circulatory massages. I usually combine techniques into a customized massage, but if you have a preference for one style, I will be happy to accommodate you.</p>
   <p>When I work with you, I will ask several questions up front in order to fully understand the situation that created the issue. Then I will develop a  customized massage to address the problem. One session may be enough,  however, more chronic problems often take more than one session. You will be the judge of that.</p>
   <p>I truly enjoy the challenge of designing a healing plan and working together to increase your quality of life. I believe each person is in  control of his or her own healing journey and feel privileged to be able to  help in that process.</p>
   <p>I look forward to meeting you!</p>
